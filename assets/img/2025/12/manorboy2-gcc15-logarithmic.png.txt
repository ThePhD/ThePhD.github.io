Title: "Knuth Closure Test - Man or Boy (LOGARITHMIC SCALE)
(GNU 15.2.0 on Darwin 24.6.0-arm64 at 2025-12-28T04:14:02Z)". Description: "A benchmark for determining the runtime of a Wikibooks / Rosetta Code example under many different kinds of languages."

There are 14 groups, and 2 data labels (cpu time, real time) per each group with data. Lower is better. 

- Lambdas (Rosetta Code) is 14th. Described as: "The use of C++-style lambdas in the Man or boy tests".
  Measures to a mean of "4218656688393.2334" femtoseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- GNU Nested Functions (Rosetta Code) is 13th. Described as: "The use of the GNU Nested Functions C extension for the Man or Boy tests.".
  Measures to a mean of "174346501246.4768" femtoseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- GNU Nested Functions is 12th. Described as: "The use of the GNU Nested Functions C extension for the Man or Boy tests.".
  Measures to a mean of "173355357747.6824" femtoseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- C++03 shared_ptr (Rosetta Code) is 11th. Described as: "The use of a std::shared_ptr with a run() function in the Man or boy tests. Does not use operator().".
  Measures to a mean of "72536178634.2326" femtoseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- Lambdas (std::function) is 10th. Described as: "The use of C++-style lambdas in the Man or boy tests. Wraps the lambdas in a std::function.".
  Measures to a mean of "33090932374.14491" femtoseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- Normal Functions (Thread Local) is 9th. Described as: "The use of plain C functions with thread local variables for data transfer in the Man or Boy tests.".
  Measures to a mean of "5861828293.318605" femtoseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- Normal Functions (Static) is 8th. Described as: "The use of plain C functions with static variables for data transfer in the Man or Boy tests.".
  Measures to a mean of "4782553861.317718" femtoseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- Custom C++ Class is 7th. Described as: "The use of a custom-written C++ class with operator() in the Man or boy tests.".
  Measures to a mean of "2673161826.394454" femtoseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- Normal Functions (Rosetta Code) is 6th. Described as: "The use of plain C functions in the Man or Boy tests. Modifies the function arguments list to transfer data.".
  Measures to a mean of "2653417714.532889" femtoseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- Lambdas (std::function_ref) is 5th. Described as: "The use of C++-style lambdas in the Man or boy tests. Wraps the lambdas in a std::function_ref.".
  Measures to a mean of "2485356115.8098907" femtoseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- Normal Functions is 4th. Described as: "The use of plain C functions in the Man or Boy tests. Modifies the function arguments list to transfer data. Does not have an eval helper like in the Rosetta code functions.".
  Measures to a mean of "2451566549.2347894" femtoseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- Lambdas is 3rd. Described as: "The use of C++-style lambdas in the Man or boy tests. Uses templates to never erase the type: hard-codes recursion limit.".
  Measures to a mean of "1687495316.989901" femtoseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- Lambdas (No Function Helpers) is 2nd. Described as: "The use of C++-style lambdas in the Man or boy tests. Uses templates to never erase the type: hard-codes recursion limit, uses no regular helper functions.".
  Measures to a mean of "1205418770.8226464" femtoseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- noop is 1st. Described as: "Measures doing literally nothing (no written expressions/statements in the benchmarking loop). Can be useful for determining potential environment noise.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.0006818771362304689" femtoseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
