Title: "Knuth Closure Test - Man or Boy  
(GNU 15.2.0 on arm64)". Description: "A benchmark for determining the runtime of a Wikibooks / Rosetta Code example under many different kinds of languages."

There are 11 groups, and 2 data labels (cpu time, real time) per each group with data. Lower is better. 

- lambda_rosetta is 11th. Described as: "The use of C++-style lambdas in the Man or boy tests".
  Measures to a mean of "4402.1432193709015" microseconds, from 50 multi-iteration samples.
- gnu_nested_functions_rosetta is 10th. Described as: "The use of the GNU Nested Functions C extension for the Man or Boy tests.".
  Measures to a mean of "160.48637672428822" microseconds, from 50 multi-iteration samples.
- gnu_nested_functions is 9th. Described as: "The use of the GNU Nested Functions C extension for the Man or Boy tests.".
  Measures to a mean of "155.427871331936" microseconds, from 50 multi-iteration samples.
- cxx03_shared_ptr_rosetta is 8th. Described as: "The use of a std::shared_ptr with a run() function in the Man or boy tests. Does not use operator().".
  Measures to a mean of "73.04253532885521" microseconds, from 50 multi-iteration samples.
- lambda_std_function is 7th. Described as: "The use of C++-style lambdas in the Man or boy tests. Wraps the lambdas in a std::function.".
  Measures to a mean of "34.7606172907998" microseconds, from 50 multi-iteration samples.
- normal_functions_rosetta is 6th. Described as: "The use of plain C functions in the Man or Boy tests. Modifies the function arguments list to transfer data.".
  Measures to a mean of "2.814117491477703" microseconds, from 50 multi-iteration samples.
- custom_callable_cxx is 5th. Described as: "The use of a custom-written C++ class with operator() in the Man or boy tests.".
  Measures to a mean of "2.699037003299834" microseconds, from 50 multi-iteration samples.
- lambda_function_ref is 4th. Described as: "The use of C++-style lambdas in the Man or boy tests. Wraps the lambdas in a std::function_ref.".
  Measures to a mean of "2.570323758153754" microseconds, from 50 multi-iteration samples.
- lambda is 3rd. Described as: "The use of C++-style lambdas in the Man or boy tests. Uses templates to never erase the type: hard-codes recursion limit.".
  Measures to a mean of "1.7240036360994495" microseconds, from 50 multi-iteration samples.
- lambda_all_lambdas is 2nd. Described as: "The use of C++-style lambdas in the Man or boy tests. Uses templates to never erase the type: hard-codes recursion limit, uses no regular helper functions.".
  Measures to a mean of "1.2094417716672843" microseconds, from 50 multi-iteration samples.
- noop is 1st. Described as: "Measures doing literally nothing (no written expressions/statements in the benchmarking loop). Can be useful for determining potential environment noise.".
  Measures to a mean of "6.914138793945314e-13" microseconds, from 50 multi-iteration samples.
