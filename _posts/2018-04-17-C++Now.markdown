I'll be attending the [C++ Now 2018](http://cppnow.org/) conference in Aspen, Colorado, USA! And, while I'm there, I'll be [giving a talk](http://sched.co/EJjw) while also participating as a Student Volunteer.

Three people really encouraged me to apply and go. I would have never touched the application had it not been for them, so Thank You to Jason Turner ([@lefticus](https://twitter.com/lefticus)), Simon Brand ([ @TartanLlama](https://twitter.com/TartanLlama)) and Mark Zeren for giving me the gentle nudge to go all the way. Sometimes, people underestimate what a little encouragement can do: sometimes, thumbs up is all it takes!

I'm incredibly fortunate to be afforded this opportunity by the C++ Now Program Committee, and I hope to make the whole ordeal a blast! üéâ
