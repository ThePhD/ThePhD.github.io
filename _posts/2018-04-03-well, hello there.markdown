It is time we got started with all this fun stuff, right? Blog posts and everything else galore, woohoo!

<!--more-->

The posts made here will be for tracking personal endeavors and my own work. As always, opinions are my own, and do not reflect anyone I am affiliated with, employ, or are employed by. Boring legalese statements side...

There is so much I have to talk about! And the best part is, writing it down here means I will not have to sit in a Slack or a Discord or elsewhere and talk about it. Instead, I can _write_ about it and everyone will be able to see it! 

Or nobody, but that would imply I am not popular. I am _totally_ popular. Or at least, I am going to be.

Soon.â„¢
