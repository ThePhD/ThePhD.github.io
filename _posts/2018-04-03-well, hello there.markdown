It is time we got started with all this fun stuff, right? Blog posts and everything else galore, woohoo!

The posts made here will be for tracking personal endeavors and work. As always, opinions are my own, and do not reflect anyone I am affiliated with, employ, or are employed by. Boring legalese statements side...

There is so much I have to talk about! And the best part is, writing it down here means I will not have to sit in a Slack or a Discord or elsewhere and talk about it. Instead, I can _write_ about it and everyone will be able to see it! 

Or nobody, but that would imply I am not popular. I am _totally_ popular. Or at least, I am going to be.

Soon.™
