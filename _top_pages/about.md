# Hey there! üéâ

My name is JeanHeyd Meneide. I am a Software Engineer and the [Project Editor for ISO/IEC JTC1 SC22 WG14 - Programming Languages, C](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/contacts). I specialize in ergonomic library design, performance tuning, foreign function/language interfaces, and a little bit of graphics programming. My favorite work includes programming that enables even the newest programmers to produce high-quality code that pushes them and others towards the pit of success! Occasionally, I get stuck in a Network Programming loop üí´.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thephd/), follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/__phantomderp/), and keep track of what I'm doing on [GitHub](https://github.com/ThePhD)!

If you'd like to get down to business, you can send inquiries for work to [Shepherd of Shepherd's Oasis](https://soasis.org/contact)! Don't forget to [follow the company on LinkedIn as well](https://www.linkedin.com/company/shepherdsoasis) and [at GitHub](https://github.com/soasis).

In my free time I try to write and draw, which has naturally led me to creating this place here! I'll be posting... well, anything and everything that comes to mind that I think might be worth sharing. Feel free to poke around and examine things!
