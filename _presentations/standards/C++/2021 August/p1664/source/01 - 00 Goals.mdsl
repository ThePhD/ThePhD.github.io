# Goals 🥅

"I took my range apart, how do I put it back together again?"

Answer: with `std::ranges::reconstruct(...)`


## Verifying the Design 🔍

- 1 name (`reconstruct`)
- 1 CPO (`std::ranges::reconstruct`)
- 4 overloads with varying levels of information


## Addressing LEWG Review Feedback 💬

- "What happens if we need the original range to reconstruct properly?"
- "What happens if you can reconstruct the original range, but do it BETTER with more information?"
- "How do you deal with the iterator/sentinel-only overload and ADL problems?"


## (Also, the Wording was Bad, so we Fixed That Too.)
