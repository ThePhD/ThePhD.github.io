There once was some data in a file
A new dev wanted in a literal to compile.
They did try to include,
Put their compiler in a mood,
And got lost in errors for a while.

A lesson they learned in those days;
You can’t compile literals those ways!
So they spun up a stream,
And it worked like a dream,
Even if the file at runtime stays.

But ‘lo, their soul was chilled,
This data didn’t change post-build!
So they tried some linker tricks,
Even xxd for kicks,
And fresh fear from build scripts, instilled

See, cross-platform was a terrible pain,
Self-bundling with build steps insane.
But after days of muck,
Build assets permanently stuck,
And runtime files disappeared down the drain.

It clearly was not ideal,
To have to go through all that spiel.
So they penned a few letters,
To their peers and betters,
And came up with a bold new deal.

A few bikesheds, to avoid design pits,
And a few nights summoning their greatest wits!
But it was finally shipped,
A utility well equipped!
std::embed, compile-time resource bits.
