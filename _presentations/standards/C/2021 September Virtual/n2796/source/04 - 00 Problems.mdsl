## Oh No...

- `<stdsleep.h>`

```cpp
int __zzz(int requested_sleep_time);

_Alias stdc_sleep = __zzz;
```

- `main.c`

```cpp
#include <stdsleep.h>

int stdc_sleep(int requested_sleep_time); // ðŸ˜±
// the above is a constraint violation of the feature as-is
```


## Oh No...!!

- `<inttypes.h>`

```cpp
__int128_t __imaxabs_229(__int128_t value);

_Alias imaxabs = __imaxabs_229;
```

- `main.c`

```cpp
#include <inttypes.h>

intmax_t imaxabs(intmax_t value); // ðŸ˜±
// ... Aw shucks.
```


## Put Bluntly

- This solves my personal ABI problems ðŸ¥³!

- But it doesn't solve the Standard Library's problems?! ðŸ˜­
