There does not exist a good, flexible, backwards-compatible solution for Text in C++. Choosing a library either requires taking the entire thing (Qt), getting involved in a very complex interface (ICU), dealing with sometimes limiting API choices (CopperSpice), or having a well-done but very opinionated design set (the proposed-for-Boost Boost.Text library).

Where is the standard library-friendly, maximum performance solution for handling text encoding and decoding in C++ and C?

This project is the push to reach that goal.




# Current Funding

The project has the goal of being fully funded by mid 2020 so that all users can have a high quality solution of text that is not kept within one company or ecosystem, but ported to the Standard Library for use by everyone. If you want the proposal, please e-mail me.

Funding goes toward:

- Funding development;
- Targeting specific features;
- Covering general library support;
- Covering specific company or vendor support;
- and, Attending WG14 (C Committee) and WG21 (C++ Committee) meetings.


Specialized solutions for C++11 (or C++03) can be made. If you, your company or organization is interested in helping or need special features/early access to features listed below, please [get in touch](mailto:inquiries@soasis.org).



## Funding Goals and Progress

Below are the published funding goals. Sponsors may pay into specific goals or, if given a large enough donation, create a new goal entirely; otherwise, funding falls into the categories in a top-to-bottom, linear fashion. Goals marked (_Stretch_) are not quite bare-minimum necessary, but would be absolutely wonderful to accomplish!

- Bootstrap Initial Development, to get library tested and released;
- Reach Full-Time Text Development to reach 2020 Goal;
- Cover C Standard Library development to reach maximum amount of users with basic functionality;

_Current Goal: Bootstrap Initial Development_

Current Goal Total: $4,375.64 USD / $24,000.00 USD

# Technical Details

The work is ongoing.

The C++ library submodules and builds on top of the C one for fast-path functions. Internally, the C library is implemented with C++ and -- hopefully soon in the future -- vectorized by hand or with [SIMD/`std::experimental::simd`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/simd/simd). Document trails:

- [Latest Working Draft, C++](/_vendor/future_cxx/papers/d1629)
- [Latest Working Draft, C](/_vendor/future_cxx/papers/C%20-%20Efficient%20Character%20Conversions)


The principles and inner workings of the implementation are detailed in a series of talks, slides and posts:

  _Lucky 7 - Designing Text Encodings for C++_  
  April 30th, 2020  
  Virtual Conference  
  - Abstract: Text handling in the C and C++ Standards is a tale of legacy encodings and a demonstration of decisions made that work at the moment don‚Äôt scale up to the needs of tomorrow. With Unicode on the horizon, C++20 prepared fundamental changes such as char8_t and polishing a things to make it easier to catch bad conversions and logical program errors when working with encoded text. Still, the landscape has poor support for transcoding from one encoding to the other, let alone talking about higher level algorithms such as how to compare two text forms which render identical to the user but have different bit patterns. This talk explores the fundamental design space behind Encoding, Decoding and Transcoding text. It describes the benefits of the API under active consideration of text, potential speed gains from such an API, and how it enables better handling of complex tasks such as normalization.
