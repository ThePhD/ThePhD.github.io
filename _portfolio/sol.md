Sol is a feature-rich, performance-oriented, clean-interface Lua <-> C++ binding that comes with its own documentation. It has been picked up by several projects to replace both LuaBridge, Luabind, OOLua and several other custom integrations, most notably by the Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator (MAME) project.

An embedded scripting language layer for C++ has never felt more powerful: [dive in to the documentation and take control of your scripting layer](http://sol2.rtfd.io/).
