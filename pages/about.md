# Hey there!

My name is JeanHeyd Meneide. I am a Software Engineer and the Project Editor for ISO/IEC JTC1 SC22 WG14 - Programming Languages, C. I specialize in ergonomic library design and performance tuning. My favorite work includes programming that enables even the newest programmers to produce high-quality code that pushes them and others towards the pit of success.

You can send inquiries for work to [Shepherd](shepherd@soasis.org) of Shepherd's Oasis!

In my free time I try to write and draw, which has naturally led me to creating this place here! I'll be posting... well, anything and everything that comes to mind that I think might be worth sharing. Feel free to poke around and examine things!
